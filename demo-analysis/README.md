Demographics Data Analysis

The program calculates and displays the cross-table of Gross State Product GSP level per capita (above average vs below average) vs alcohol consumption level (above average vs below average) in 2009. The program also produces a scatter plot of GSP pc vs alcohol consumption pc.

The correlation between alcohol consumption per capita and GSP per capita is about .48, which indicates that there exists no linear correlation between the two measures.
