The network consist of six distinct communities with a modularity of 0.48 where the members of each community
   share some similarity. The majority of the nutrients with a number name is concentrated in
   the first community along with different types of vitamins. Another interesting note, is how different types of
   sugar such as sucrose, maltose, lactose, and starch are within the first community. The second community consists
   of different types of fatty acids in addition to nutrients with number names. The third community consist mostly
   of amino acids (alanine, arginine, cystine) and the general chemical elements (calcium, copper, magnesium). The
   fourth community is the smallest consisting only of one member, energy, which seems to have no association with
   any other nutrients in the network. The fifth community consist of vitamin-based nutrients, while the sixth
   communities consist of two members, caffeine and theobromine, which are similar in that they are alkaloids.
