Network of Nutrients
---
The data comes from the USDA nutrient database which contains information about 9000 food items and 150 constituent nutrients. The program assumes two nutrients are similar if their amounts in all food items are strongly correlated: the correlation is not less than 0.5. The program uses the nutrition data (files NUT_DATA.txt and NUTR_DEF.txt from the full ASCII version) to construct a network of similar nutrients.

In collaboration with A. Deka.
