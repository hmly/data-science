Text Analysis
---
The program calculates word sentiment level, based on the user reviews from the Yelp academic dataset.

Each review has a text fragment and a star rating on the scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). We assume that the words predominantly used in "bad" reviews are "bad" and the words predominantly used in "good" reviews are "good." The measure of the sentiment level of a word, therefore, is the average star rating of all reviews where the word is used. 

In collaboration with A. Deka.
